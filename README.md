# ArcadeShootEmUp

It used to be my Graduate work

Looks like Space Invaders (though, come to think of it, it's more like Chicken Invaders)

Airplane and shooter. There is not a lot of content, but everything is done so that it can be added without even getting into the code (but not in the game, but in the engine itself). That is, it works well
